            <p>
                I attended the Information Technology voc tech program at Quincy High School, and graduated in 2018 with a weighted GPA of 4.5. I was a member of several clubs and societies, including Innovative Engineers, SkillsUSA, Robotics, and the National Honor Society.
                After that I attended Wentworth Institute of Technology, and I graduated in August 2022 with a BS in Computer Science and a minor in Applied Math.

                In the fall semester of 2021 I completed an internship with athenahealth. During my 10 weeks there I wrote a user config script for their work queue system, athenaWorker. Since graduating, I also worked part time at the Stop and Shop supermarket. 
                I started as a cashier, and within months I was running the customer service desk, supervising the front end, and performing the daily cash balance. While I was working and applying for jobs, I also participated in a few game jams.

                I'm proficient with a variety of programming languages, including Python, Java, and C#. I'd also consider myself a diligent worker, someone who is patient and open to new ideas but who won't hesitate to contribute his own.
                I'm currently working on my CompTIA Security+ certification. And although I do not have an active security clearance, I am eligible for a Top Security clearance based on my application for a job within the Department of Defense that unfortunately fell through recently.
