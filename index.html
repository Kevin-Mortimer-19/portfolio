            I graduated from Wentworth Institute of Technology in August 2022. Since then I've developed a variety of personal projects, worked part time, and looked for the right opportunity. I thought I'd found the right place to start my career in February 2024 
            when I received a conditional job offer from a federal agency. After a year's worth of security processing and a move down to Odenton, MD, the job offer fell through. Now I'm back to looking for the right place to start my career.

            I'm a huge fan of games of all kinds. Trading cards, tabletop roleplay, video games, I love the math and the art behind all of them. I also love working with software! Web, mobile apps, video games, databases, AI, and so much more. No matter the field, I always want to learn more and develop my skills.
